# TRILINOS PACKAGE DEVELOPERS:
#
# Use this Doxyfile in Trilinos/packages/YOUR_PACKAGE/doc to control the
# way in which your documentation is generated. Do not modify the @INCLUDE
# line above--that provides you with default behavior. To modify the
# default behavior, simply include (below) the option you would like to
# overwrite (or use += to append more to the default). 
#
# There are essentially two types of configuration options: 
#
#   1) those that you can overwrite completely, and
#   2) those that you can overwrite for local generation, but that are 
#      automatically overwritten by TrilinosWeb before being posted online
#
# Both are present in Trilinos/packages/common/Doxyfile. The first type are 
# simply present without note, while the second type are noted as such.
#
# - IN ORDER FOR TrilinosWeb TO FIND YOUR RESOURCES, you must give all paths 
#   up to Trilinos' parent and back down to your resource (see the @INCLUDE
#   above for an example). This should ALWAYS be:
#
#       ../../../../Trilinos/YOUR_RESOURCE...
#
#   and will usually be:
#
#       ../../../../Trilinos/packages/YOUR_PACKAGE/YOUR_RESOURCE...
#
#   IF YOU DON'T DO THIS, DOXYGEN WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LOCATE YOUR RESOURCES!
#
# - To view the explanation of an option, run 
#
#     doxygen -g COMMENTED_DOXYFILE_NAME
#     (open COMMENTED_DOXYFILE_NAME)
#
#   or visit http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/config.html
#
# - To use this Doxyfile locally to generate your documentation and 
#   iteratively develop it:
#
#     cd Trilinos/packages/YOUR_PACKAGE/doc
#     (modify this Doxyfile accordingly)
#     doxygen
#     (open Trilinos/packages/YOUR_PACKAGE/doc/html/index.html)
#     rinse, repeat.
#
# - At the very least, you will need to overwrite the INPUT option.
